# Approximate-ALU-Design
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Approximate ALU Design project. The project focuses on designing an approximate adder and an approximate multiplier using Verilog, which will be used in an approximate Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The aim is to compare the area of exact and approximate adders and multipliers and evaluate their performance using various metrics such as error rate (ER) and mean relative error distance (MRED). Additionally, the project explores the integration of the approximate ALU within a Finite State Machine (FSM) to leverage its operations and reduce the error rate and mean relative error distance.

The Approximate ALU Design project aims to explore the implementation and performance evaluation of approximate adders and multipliers using Verilog. By employing approximation techniques, we can achieve a trade-off between accuracy and resource utilization, which can be highly beneficial in many applications where strict precision is not required.

The project includes the following components:

Approximate/Exact adder design
Approximate/Exact multiplier design
Approximate ALU
Correcting the ALU using FSM 
Testbench for the corrected ALU
