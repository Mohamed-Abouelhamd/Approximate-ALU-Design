# Approximate-ALU-Design
The project aims to design an approximate adder and an approximate multiplier to use them in an approximate ALU using verilog. 
A comparizon between the area of exact and approximate adders and multipliers was done.
Some Metrics are used to assess the performance of the adder and multiplier like error rate (ER) and mean relative error distance (MRED). 
These materics were calculated using matlab simulation codes and also calculated analytically.
The approximate ALU is used in an FSM to benefit from the rest of its operation to decrease ER and MRED.
